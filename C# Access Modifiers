C# Access Modifiers

Access Modifiers

By now, you are quite familiar with the public keyword that appears in many of our examples:

public string color;

The public keyword is an access modifier, which is used to set the access level/visibility for classes, fields, methods and properties.

C# has the following access modifiers:


There's also two combinations: protected internal and private protected.

For now, lets focus on public and private modifiers.

Private Modifier
If you declare a field with a private access modifier, it can only be accessed within the same class:

Example

class Car
 
{
  private string model = "Mustang";

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.model);
  }
}
The output will be:

Mustang
